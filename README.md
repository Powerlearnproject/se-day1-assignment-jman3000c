#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods, and tools to the development and maintenance of high-quality software systems. It involves the design, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance of software products.  Software engineering plays a crucial role in the technology industry by enabling the creation of software applications and systems that power various aspects of modern life, including communication, commerce, entertainment, and healthcare

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Milestones include the development of programming languages (e.g., Fortran, C), the establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960s, the advent of structured programming in the 1970s, and the rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
 The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) consists of several phases, including:
  - Requirements: Gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
  - Design: Creating high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
  - Implementation: Writing code and building the software according to the design specifications.
  - Testing: Conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
  - Deployment: Releasing the software to users or customers.
  - Maintenance: Providing ongoing support, updates, and enhancements to the software after deployment.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
- Waterfall: A linear and sequential approach where each phase (e.g., requirements, design, implementation, testing, deployment) must be completed before moving to the next. This method is best suited for projects with well-defined requirements and minimal expected changes, such as building a house or construction projects.

- Agile: An iterative and incremental approach that emphasises flexibility, collaboration, and adaptability to change. Work is divided into small cycles (sprints) with continuous feedback, making it ideal for dynamic environments like software development, where user needs evolve, such as mobile app development or startup product iterations.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
- Software Developer: Responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions.
- - Quality Assurance Engineer: Ensures software quality by designing and executing test 
plans.
- Project Manager: Oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
- Software Developer: Responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions.
- Quality Assurance Engineer: Ensures software quality by designing and executing test 
plans.
- Project Manager: Oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
- Changing Requirements: Requirements may change during the development cycle, 
leading to scope creep and project delays.
- Tight Deadlines: Pressure to deliver software products on schedule can result in rushed 
development and compromised quality.
- Technical Debt: Accrued from shortcuts or suboptimal solutions, technical debt can 
impede future development efforts and increase maintenance costs.

 Strategies for Overcoming Challenges: Strategies for overcoming challenges include 
effective communication, agile methodologies, prioritization of tasks, and regular 
reassessment of project goals and timelines.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
- Importance of Testing: Testing is a critical aspect of QA and involves various types of testing, 
including:
  - Unit Testing: Testing individual components or modules of software.
  - Integration Testing: Testing interactions between different components or subsystems.
  - System Testing: Testing the entire software system as a whole.
  - Acceptance Testing: Testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user 
needs.

 Importance of Quality Control: Quality control measures such as code reviews, automated 
testing, and continuous integration help identify and fix defects early in the development 
process, leading to higher-quality software products

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the process of designing and refining input prompts to guide AI models, particularly generative AI, to produce desired and high-quality outputs. It involves choosing the most effective words, phrases, and formats to instruct the AI to perform tasks accurately and relevantly.  

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague Prompt:

Write about animals.

This prompt is vague because it lacks direction and context.  It doesn't specify what kind of writing, which animals, or what aspect of animals to focus on.  The AI might generate a very general and potentially unhelpful response.

Improved Prompt:

Describe the physical characteristics, habitat, and diet of African elephants in a short paragraph suitable for elementary school students.

This improved prompt is clear, specific, and concise because:

- Clear: It explicitly states the task: "Describe".
Specific: It defines the subject ("African elephants") and the aspects to cover ("physical characteristics, habitat, and diet"). It also specifies the target audience and format ("short paragraph suitable for elementary school students").
- Concise: It uses straightforward language and avoids unnecessary jargon.
